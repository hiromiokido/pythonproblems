# Python for fun (as least that's what I want to believe)
This repo has been a long-time interest of mine, to train, develop and diversify my knowledge about Python (obviously).
Here I can test new libraries, have fun and just solve small programming challenges.
I am interested in studying Computer Vision and Deep Learning using OpenCV and Pytorch.

## Content
The exercises vary from [HackerRank](ww.hackerrank.com) to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) or wharever.

## Yay! :D
