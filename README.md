# Python for fun (as least that's what I want to believe)
This repo has been a long-time interest of mine, to train, develop and diversify my knowledge about Python (obviously). Here I can test new libraries, have fun and just solve small programming challenges.

## Content
The exercises vary from [HackerRank](ww.hackerrank.com) to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) or whaverer.
